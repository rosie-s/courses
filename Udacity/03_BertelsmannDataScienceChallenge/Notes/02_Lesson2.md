# Lesson 2 - _Visualizing Data_

## Frequency
- **_Frequency:_**  The frequency of a data set is the number of times a certain outcome occurs.

- **_Relative Frequency:_** To compute relative frequency, one obtains a frequency count for the total population and 
a frequency count for a subgroup of the population.

- **_Proportion:_** The fraction of counts over the total sample. A proportion can be turned into a percentage by 
multiplying the proportion by 100.

## Histograms
- **_Histogram:_**  A graphical representation of the distribution of data, discrete intervals (bins) are decided 
upon to form widths for our boxes.

### Skewed Distribution
- **_Positive Skew:_** When outliers are present along the _right_ most end of the distribution.

- **_Negative Skew:_** When outliers are present along the _left_ most end of the distribution.
