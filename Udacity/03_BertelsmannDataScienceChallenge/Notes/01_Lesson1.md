# Lesson 1 - _Intro to Statistical Research Methods_

## Constructs

- **_Construct:_** Anything that is difficult to measure because it
can be defined and measured in many different ways. 
    
- **_Operational Definition:_** The operational definition of a construct is the
unit of measurement we are using for the construct. Once we operationally define something
it is no longer a construct.

## Population vs Sample
- **_Population:_** All the individuals in a group.   

- **_Sample:_** Some of the individuals in a group.

- **_Parameter vs Statistic:_** A _parameter_ defines a characteristic of the
population whereas a _statistic_ defines a characteristic of the sample.

## Experimentation
- **_Treatment:_** In an experiment, the manner in which researchers handle subjects
is called a treatment. Researchers are specifically interested in how different treatments
might yield differing results.    

- **_Observational Study:_** When an experimenter
watches a group of subjects and does not introduce a treatment, e.g. a survey.   
 
- **_Independent Variable:_** The independent variable of a study is the
variable that experimenters choose to manipulate; it is usually plotted along the x-axis of a
graph.    

- **_Dependent Variable:_** The dependent variable of a study is the variable
that experimenters choose to measure during an experiment; it is usually plotted along the
y-axis of a graph.

- **_Treatment Group:_** The group of a study that receives varying levels of
the independent variable. These groups are used to measure the effect of a treatment.
Control Group. The group of a study that receives no treatment. This
group is used as a baseline when comparing treatment groups.    

- **_Placebo:_** Something given to subjects in the control group so they think
they are getting the treatment, when in reality they are getting something that causes no effect
to them. (e.g. a Sugar pill)

- **_Blinding:_** Blinding is a technique used to reduce bias. Double blinding
ensures that both those administering treatments and those receiving treatments do not know
who is receiving which treatment.
