# Lesson 5 - _Standardizing_

## Z score
- **_Standard Score:_** Given an observed value _x_, the Z score finds the number of Standard 
deviations _x_ is away from the mean.

### Standard Normal Curve

This curve is the resulting distribution we get when we standardize our scores. We will use
this distribution along with the Z table to compute percentages above, below, or in between
observations in later sections.

## Examples
### Finding Standard Score
#### Example 5.1 
The average height of a professional basketball player was 2.00 meters with a
standard deviation of 0.02 meters. Harrison Barnes is a basketball player who measures 2.03
meters. How many standard deviations from the mean is Barnes’ height?

First we should sketch the normal curve that represents the distribution of basketball player
heights.

</p>

_Figure 5.2:_ Notice we place the mean height 2.00 right in the middle and make tick marks that
are each 1 standard deviation or 0.02 meters away in both directions.

Next we should compute the standard score (i.e. z score) for Barnes’ height. Since μ = 2.00,
sDev = 0.02, and x = 2.03 we can find the z-score

- _x-μ/sDev = 2.03-2.00/0.02 = 0.03/0.02 = 1.5_

_Finding 1.5 as the z score tells us that Barnes’ height is 1.5 standard deviations from the mean, 
that is 1.5sDev + μ = Barnes’ Height_

#### Example 5.2
The average height of a professional hockey player is 1.86 meters with a
standard deviation of 0.06 meters. Tyler Myers, a professionally hockey, is the same height as
Harrison Barnes. Which of the two is taller in their respective league?

To find Tyler Myers standard score we can use the information: μ = 1.86, sDev = 0.06, and
x = 2.03. This results in the standard score:

- _x-μ/sDev = 2.03-1.86/0.06 = 0.17/0.06 = 2.833_

Comparing the two z-scores we see that Tyler Myers score of 2.833 is larger than Barnes’ score of
1.5. This tells us that there are more hockey players shorter than Myers than there are basketball
players shorter than Barnes’.
