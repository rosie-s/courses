# Lesson 7 - _Sampling Distributions_

## Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem is used to help us understand the following facts regardless of whether the population distribution is normal or not:
1. the _mean_ of the sample means is the same as the population mean
2. the _standard_ deviation of the sample means is always equal to the standard error (i.e. SE = sd/square root of n)
3. the _distribution_ of sample means will become increasingly more normal as the sample size, n, increases.

- **_Sampling Distribution:_** The sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of that statistic. It may be considered as the distribution of the statistic for all possible samples from the same population of a given size.
