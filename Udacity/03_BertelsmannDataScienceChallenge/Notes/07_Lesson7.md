# Lesson 7 - _Sampling Distributions_

## Central Limit Theorem

The CLT is used to help us understand the following facts regardless of whether the population distribution is normal or not:
1. _Mean_ of the sample means is the same as the population mean
2. _Standard_ deviation of the sample means is always equal to the standard error (i.e. SE = sd/square root of n)
3. _Distribution_ of sample means will become increasingly more normal as the sample size, n, increases.

- **_Sampling Distribution:_** The distribution of that statistic. It may be considered as the distribution of the statistic for all possible samples from the same population of a given size.

## Example 7.1
We are interested in the average height of trees in a particular forest. To get
results quickly we had 5 students go out and measure a sample of 20 trees. Each student returned
with the average tree height from their samples.

Sample results : 35.23 , 36.71, 33.21, 38.2, 35.54

If it is known that the population average of tree heights in the forest is 36 feet with a standard
deviation of 2 feet. How many Standard errors is the students average away from the population
mean?

To solve this problem we first need to find the average of these students averages so

xÂ¯ = 35.23+36.71+33.21+38.2+35.54 / 5 = 35.78

Now we find our Standard error of the sample:

SE = s / square root of n = 2 / 5 = 0.4

So now to get the number of standard errors away from the mean our observation is we can
use the z-score formula:

35.78 - 36 / 0.4 = 0.55

So our sample distribution is relatively close to the population distribution!
