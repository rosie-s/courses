# Lesson 3 - _Central Tendency_

## Mean, Median and Mode

- **_Mean:_** The numerical average and can be computed by dividing the sum of all the 
data points by the number of data points

  -  _The mean is heavily affected by outliers, therefore we say the mean is not a robust measurement._
  
- **_Median:_** The data point that is directly in the middle of the data set. 
If two numbers are in the middle then the median is the average of the two.
  1. The data set is _odd_ n/2 = the position in the data set the middle value is
  2. The data set is _even_ xk+xk+1 / n gives the median for the two middle data points        
 
   The median is robust to outliers, therefore an outlier will not affect the value of the median._

- **_Mode:_** The data point that occurs the most frequently in the data set.

   -  _The mode is robust to outliers as well._    
   -  _In the normal distribution the mean = median = mod_
